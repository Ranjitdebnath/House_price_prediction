# Bangalore Real Estate Price Prediction Model
This Model predicts real estate price in Bangalore. Many times we have come across websites like "Magicbricks.com" where they sell and estimate the price of the property in many part of the country, so this model is also inspired by the concept of predicting property prices based on the square_feet_area, bedrooms, bathrooms and location.In this project I built the model using sklearn and machine learning algorithm using Bangalore home prices dataset from kaggle.com .During model building I came across all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, k fold cross validation etc.

# Technologies used:
1.Python as language
2.Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3.Matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
4.Sklearn for model building
5.Jupyter notebook as IDE
